## What is a security key?

It's a hardware used for login, to authenticate you, with strong security technology under the hood. That keeps
 it simple to use but safer.

When a web require you to login, the key will ask you to touch or unlock and sign the login request. That sign
 is unique for each login and domain name is checked. So, if you are in a phishing site, the key will not sign
 the request and the login will fail, keeping your account safe.

This way, the web knows that you are the owner of the account and not a attacker.

## How can it help to protect accounts in your company?

Passwords can be shared, stolen, guessed or be in a post-it. But, the security key is a physical device. So,
 if a attacker knows the password, it will not be able to login without the key. Also, as the domain name is
 checked, phishing attacks with similar domains are mitigated.

## Which is the best security key?

One of the best security key is the Yubico Yubikey 5 Series. But, if you are not professional a cheaper option is
 the Yubico Security Key Series.

The main difference between both are the Yubico OTP, smart card, OpenPGP and similar features but both support web
 auth and passwordless login.
