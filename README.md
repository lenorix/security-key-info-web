## What is a security key?

It's a hardware used for login, to authenticate you, with strong security technology under the hood. That keeps
 it simple to use but safe.

## Which is the best security key?

One of the best security key is the Yubico Yubikey 5 Series. But, if you are not professional a cheaper option is
 the Yubico Security Key Series. The main difference between both are the Yubico OTP, smart card, OpenPGP and
 similar features but both support web auth and passwordless login.
